# Testcase Example:  '[3,4,5,1,2]'
#
# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
# to you beforehand.
#
# (i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
#
# Find the minimum element.
#
# You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
# Output: 1
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
# Output: 0
